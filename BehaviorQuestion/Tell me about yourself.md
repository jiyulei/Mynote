Hi my name is Jiyu, a frontend developer with about four years of experience building and optimizing web applications. I have mainly worked with **React**, **Next**.**js**, **TypeScript**, and **GraphQL**.

At Torpago, I built and optimized frontend components, using **SSR** and **SSG** in **Next**.js to speed up page loads. One of the more interesting projects I worked on was a credit card application flow, making the process smoother.

Before that, at Kroger, I worked on building an internal **CMS** system that powers the homepages for 20+ banners, covering stores across 30+ states and serving over 10 million daily users. (I used Redux for state management and React hooks/context to optimize performance.)

Lately, I have been exploring SolidJS, which is even faster than React in terms of performance. (I love working on frontend performance and building smooth user experiences), Iâ€™m excited about this opportunity and see where I can contribute.
